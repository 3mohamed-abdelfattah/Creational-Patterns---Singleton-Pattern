# Creational Patterns - Singleton Pattern

## Overview

The Singleton Pattern is one of the simplest design patterns in software engineering. It belongs to the creational patterns group, which deals with object creation mechanisms. The primary purpose of the Singleton Pattern is to ensure that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

## Why Use Singleton Pattern?

1. **Controlled Access to a Single Instance:** Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
2. **Reduced Memory Footprint:** Prevents unnecessary instantiation of objects.
3. **Global Access:** Provides a global point of access to the instance.
